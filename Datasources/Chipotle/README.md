# Chipotle US Location Data Analysis  

**Tools Used:** Tableau  
**Dataset:** [Chipotle Locations (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations)  

## Overview  
This project analyzes the geographic distribution of Chipotle restaurants across the United States. Using Tableau, I created interactive dashboards to visualize density by state and highlight regional trends.  

## Process  
- Imported Kaggle dataset of ~2,500 Chipotle restaurant locations.  
- Cleaned and structured data for Tableau visualization.  
- Built dashboards with **heatmaps** and **bar charts** to highlight density at the state level.  

## Key Insights  
- **California and Texas** lead by number of Chipotle locations, reflecting population density and market penetration.  
- The Midwest and Southeast show lower density, indicating growth opportunities for expansion.
